11. Q&A Slide

Design Considerations:
- Use a consistent, professional theme
- Include visualizations (diagrams, charts) where possible
- Keep text minimal â€“ use bullet points for key information
- Include slide numbers for easy reference during Q&A

### Prepare Live Demo

1. Demo Environment Setup
   - Ensure a stable OCI environment for the demo
   - Prepare backup plans (e.g., recorded video) in case of technical issues

2. Demo Script
   - Introduction to the application
   - Show normal operation
   - Demonstrate monitoring dashboard
   - Trigger a self-healing scenario (e.g., kill a pod)
   - Show auto-scaling in action with a load test

3. Rehearse the Demo
   - Practice the entire demo multiple times
   - Prepare for potential questions or issues

4. Technical Setup
   - Test all necessary tools (screen sharing, terminal access)
   - Prepare shortcuts or aliases for long commands
   - Set up multiple terminal windows/tabs for quick access

5. Timing
   - Aim for a 5-10 minute demo
   - Leave time for explanation and questions

## Deliverables
